class_name TrapState
extends RefCounted

## Per-trap authoritative state (architecture rule 1: plain data, no Node).
## Effect fields are resolved once at placement from the TrapDef (same
## pattern as EnemyState.step_units — defs are read once). Exhausted
## ON_ENTER traps are removed from BattleModel.traps entirely, so every
## element of that array is a living trap.
